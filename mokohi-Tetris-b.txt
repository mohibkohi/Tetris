Assignment Overview:
From my point of view, the purpose of the second part of this project was to see the extend to how much students are 
comfortable using everything they have learned this quarter. 


Technical Impression:
Working on the second part of Tetris project has been a lot of fun, not just because i get to play Tetris each time i want to 
check my program, but because i got to apply everything that i have learned this quarter, after applying some stuff that i have 
learned i am really impressed with what i can do with java language. This project was a lot of fun, since i was given the option 
to add extra credit options. It is kind of more fun when students who want to add extra features are given the option to do so 
weather they choose to do it or not. Even though i didn’t get to add some other extra options that i wanted to it was still fun 
to think about extra features and add some interesting stuff to my Tetris game. I started the second part of this project the same 
way i did every other project, finishing all the requirements first before thinking about doing any extra work, it get really 
tempting to do extra credits before finishing the core requirements, but from part a of this project i learned that it is very 
important to finish the requirements before going about doing any extra credits, since you don’t know how long it would take to 
finish the extra credits. After finishing the requirements i started doing some extra credit options, some were easier than others, 
but i managed to add at least five, i don’t know how much credit i will be getting for them, but i did what i wanted to, when 
i was doing extra credits as i was importing the jar files to add sounds, my program kind of got missed up form the SVN and i 
wasn’t able to debug or run my program on other computers, after looking for help online and from other people, i didn’t find 
what the problem is or how to solve it, so i stopped trying to fix it and just thought about doing another project with different 
name, I started a new project from the given code and redid my classes and packages and i named it “mokohi2-tetris”, this is 
the project that i would like to be looked at for my grade. And thanks a lot Mr: Bryan for giving me the option to use a 
different name, i am new to SVN and not really sure how everything works with it.
